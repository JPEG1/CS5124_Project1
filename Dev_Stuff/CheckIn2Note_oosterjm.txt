My progress on the project is going well. I am currently working on some of the advanced functionality that I mentioned in the project mockups I submitted with the last check-in (font size, color blind mode, selecting different visualizations, etc). I am hoping to finish up the codebase completely tomorrow (Saturday, 2-24-2024). Then on Monday—if I deem necessary when reviewing the rubric—do a couple touch-ups to get the project to a point I'm happy with. Throughout this week I'll also be planning out how my presentation of the project will be going. I know the presentations are meant to be brief, so I may not prepare any slideshow or graphics. Alternatively, I may want to briefly show the mockups I created and design process as well (still undecided).

I know one of the primary purposes of the check-ins is to answer questions, and I only have 1 question that I am unsure of, but which I assume we'll discuss in class this week: How do you expect the submission? There may be details on the project assignment page that I missed, but should I work on integrating this into my wix website via a link or page transition button? Or is this an 'offline' submission which we simply submit the codebase and you'll run them locally?

Again, these are issues which I'm not all that worried about, as I imagine we'll discuss them before the code is due on Wednesday.
