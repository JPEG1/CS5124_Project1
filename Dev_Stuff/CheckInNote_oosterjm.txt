So, unfortunately, I don't have a significant codebase to share/turn in for this checkpoint. I've only gotten the base website down with the framing & subsections, but none of the actual visualization itself.
My schedule this semester (18 credit hours + part time work 16 hours Tues/Thurs) means that I knock out the vast majority of my work on the weekends. As of right now, this Saturday, 2-17-2024, is when I have carved out time to knock out ~90% of this project. I spent ~1 hour setting up the framing a few weeks back and the slotted this Saturday as my day to revisit it. That being said, this means that I am admittedly a few days behind on this checkpoint. However this isn't unforeseen and is all according to how I plan my semester out and slot various things into my schedule.

I added this note just to give some insight into my schedule and plan for tackling this project. As for the project itself, I don't have any outstanding questions and am confident that I'm well on my way.
I've included a mockup image of what the visualization ideally will look like once it's completed. This is obviously subject to change, but my plan is to follow through with the mockup that I've designed.
